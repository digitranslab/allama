## Owner

The owner role is assigned to the first user who logs into Allama. This user has admin rights to every workspace in the Allama instance.

## Domain whitelist

To prevent unauthorized access to your Allama instance, you can configure a list of allowed domains for authentication.
You can do this by setting the `ALLAMA__AUTH_ALLOWED_DOMAINS` environment variable. For example:

```bash
ALLAMA__AUTH_ALLOWED_DOMAINS=acme.com,acme.ai
```

## Authentication Methods

<Warning>
  In production, use [Google OAuth](/self-hosting/authentication/google-oauth) or [SAML SSO](/self-hosting/authentication/saml-sso).
  Basic auth is meant for local development only.
</Warning>

Allama currently supports the following authentication methods:

- `basic`: Email and Password
- `google_oauth`: Google OAuth
- `saml`: SAML SSO

Choose from a number of authentication methods listed below to get started.
