# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

Allama is built by a global community. We are committed to providing a welcoming, inclusive, and respectful environment for everyone — regardless of background, identity, or experience level.

## Expected Behaviour

- Be respectful and considerate in all interactions
- Provide constructive feedback and accept it gracefully
- Assume good intent; seek clarification before reacting
- Respect differing viewpoints and experiences
- Credit others for their contributions

## Unacceptable Behaviour

- Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination of any kind
- Personal attacks, trolling, or deliberately inflammatory remarks
- Publishing private information without explicit consent
- Sustained disruption of discussions or community spaces
- Any conduct that would be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all Allama community spaces including GitHub repositories, Discord channels, social media, events, and any context where you represent the project.

## Reporting

Report unacceptable behaviour to **conduct@digitranslab.com**. All reports will be reviewed promptly and handled confidentially. We will never publicly identify reporters without their consent.

## Enforcement

Community maintainers will respond to violations proportionally:

1. **Notice** — Private message clarifying the issue and expected behaviour
2. **Warning** — Formal warning with a defined cooling-off period
3. **Temporary Suspension** — Removal from community spaces for a set duration
4. **Permanent Ban** — Permanent removal for repeated or severe violations

Decisions are made by project maintainers and are final.
